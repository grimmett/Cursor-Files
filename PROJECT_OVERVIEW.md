3. **punchlist_items** - Individual punchlist items
4. **photos** - Photo attachments
5. **notes** - Item notes and comments
6. **project_users** - Project assignments

### Key Relationships
- Users can be assigned to multiple projects
- Projects contain multiple punchlist items
- Items can have multiple photos and notes
- Hierarchical user roles and permissions

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Mobile App
1. User authenticates and downloads project data
2. Works offline, creating/modifying items
3. Photos stored locally with metadata
4. Syncs with server when online
5. Receives updates and notifications

### Web App
1. Real-time data synchronization
2. Collaborative editing capabilities
3. Advanced filtering and reporting
4. Bulk operations and management

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Development
- Local PostgreSQL + Redis
- Docker Compose setup
- Hot reloading for all platforms

### Production
- Cloud database (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- File storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancing and scaling
- SSL/TLS encryption

## üìä Performance Considerations

- Database indexing for fast queries
- Image compression and optimization
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- CDN for static assets
- Database connection pooling

## üîß Development Workflow

### Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Run `./setup.sh` for initial setup
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start services with Docker Compose

### Development
